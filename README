Rise
====

Rise is a multiplayer 4X game.

Rise is built in java using the exultant.us Beard library (https://github.com/heavenlyhash/beard) for browser-based ui.

Development is at a very early not-even-alpha stage.  I'll be honest, it's pretty much a demo project for Beard at this point.


Compiling
---------

Ant.


Running
-------

After compiling, open the "index.html" page in the "dist" folder in a browser of your choice.
If you have java installed and set up to handle applets in your browser, you're good to go.
